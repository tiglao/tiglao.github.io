          Ellie is a curious and dynamic full-stack software engineer with a wealth of experience in creative problem-solving and collaborative work for social good. In her current role, she leverages the FARM stack, Python, and JavaScript to rapidly design and develop scalable databases and user interfaces. Ellieâ€™s passion for strategic optimization drives projects like her latest: transitioning frontend code from Javascript and Bootstrap to TypeScript and Material UI. 
          <br /><br />
          Previously, she led and supported a cross-functional team of 10, using keen observation of existing inefficiencies and knowledge gaps to develop and maintain a Notion-based custom toolset using Javascript and Node.js. This toolset significantly streamlined inventory, waste, and labor management, boosting time and cost efficiency. 
          <br /><br />
          Committed to building products that positively impact both people and planet, Ellie is enthusiastic about bringing her comprehensive skillset to new challenges and old problems.
